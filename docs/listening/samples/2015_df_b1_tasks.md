## Task 7 Email

Dear Ms. Ng,

Thank you for your love and support for Bubblegum, and I’m glad to let you know that I have agreed to let the senior students of your Media Club to interview with the members of Bubblegum. In this email, I’m writing to answer some of your questions about the interview and give you some guidelines for the interview.

To start with, I want to answer the questions about the time, place and length of the interview. The interview can take place on May 19 at Paradise Gardens Hotel Room 829. The length of the interview is one hour (from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm).

In terms of the questions for the interview, I would like the students to ask about their latest CD “Sugar Love Mountain.” Also, students can ask the members about what they think about Hong Kong. However, students cannot ask the members about their love lives, and please don’t talk about Mark Nelson’s family.

In addition, there are some other rules that the students have to follow. Students have to dress formally, so no sandals. On top of that, students have to show ID cards and have their bags and equipment searched before the interview. Also, we can only allow maximum four people to interview with the members.

Based on what I have mentioned above, I hope I have answered your questions and made it clear to you about the guidelines for the interview. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to email me again.

Yours sincerely, <br/>
Malcom Parker<br/>
Manager at North Star Artists
