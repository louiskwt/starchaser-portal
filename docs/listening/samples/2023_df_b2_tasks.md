## Task 8: Announcement

__Announcement about Teen NetChef TV Star William Puddle__

In view of the recent Puddle’s cooking video, which has gone viral, we have an announcement to make regarding the mistakes shown in the video and misunderstandings that people have about the events.

First of all, we want to acknowledge that Puddle flooded the kitchen floor because he forgot to turn off the tap. However, he only forgot to turn off the tap since Puddle and his team have just switched from an automatic tap to a manual one. As a result, he forgot that the new tap would not turn off by itself.

Besides, Puddle was seen slicing up the other ingredients without washing his hands after chopping up some raw chicken. This has led to some concerns about food safety from viewers. In fact, he had cleaned everything, but he just edited out the part where he did the cleaning because the video was too long.

On top of that, Puddle wiped his face with a tea towel, which was believed to be the same one he used to dry the raw chicken. Again, this is not the case. He used a clean one as he has 150 of the same kind.

At the end of the video, Puddle appeared to be crying, and viewers suspected  that he was very upset. Nevertheless, Pubble had been chopping onions in the show, and that was why he looked like he was crying at the end.

Based on what has been mentioned above, we hope to acknowledge the mistake of flooding the kitchen made by Puddle and clarify the misunderstandings about food safety, Puddle’s personal hygiene and his emotion state.

## Task 9: Email

__Subject: Recommended Training Courses for All Staff Members__

Dear staff members,

I am writing to provide you the information about the training courses that we recommend all staff members, not just chefs, to attend.

To start off, we highly recommend all of you go through a social media communication training course offered by PR Production, which is called Be Your Best. This course can help you learn to only say what you mean and mean what you say through teaching you the importance of Crystal Clear Communication™.

In addition, we want all our staff members to receive some fire safety traning, so we recommend all of you to sign up for the Hazard Awareness provided by Pinafore Solution. Through taking this course, you will learn how to use a fire extinguisher as well as how to keep fire exits clear. This course is suitable for everyone, not just chefs, so we recommend you all to take this course.

Lastly, in order to encourage our staff to complete food hygiene training, we recommend you all to attend the course called The Chef’s Special, which is provided by The Grill Gurus and has been approved by the Health Advisory Board. This course can guide you to avoid cross-contimination in the kitchen and provide you tips on how to have a food-safe kitchen.

All the training courses will count as credit towards your Annual Review Targets (ARTs), so completing these courses can help you with your appraisal. Besides, the first 10 members who completed the course will receive an extra day off. I hope you to see you complete the courses recommended in this email. If you have any questions regarding the courses, please email me and I am more than happy to help you sign up and pick the courses.

Best regards,<br/>
Nico Lin

## Task 10: Video Script

Are you ready for our new cookery show Viewer’s Choice? This’s not an ordinary cookery show! In fact, Viewer’s Choice is going to be ground-breaking as it’ll be the first fully interactive live cookery show that will be shown online, and viewers can vote for the ingredients they want our celebrity chiefs to use through the Teen NetChef TV app for free.

The show stars our celebrity chief William Puddle. What’s more exiting is that Mary Steward, the Queen of TV Cooking, is going to be our co-star.

If you can’t wait to watch the first episode, then let me give you a teaser about the first episode. Well, episode 1 of the show is called “Fruit Pie”, and viewers can choose between apple and blueberry for the filling of the fruit pie.

In each episode, one lucky voter will be selected to win the Big Prize once the dish is finished. That one lucky voter will receive the actual finished dish made by our chiefs, and the prize will be delivered straight to his or her door by the food delivery company Flying Food using a drone.

That’s all I can share for now. If you want to find out more, then stay tuned and don’t miss out on the first episode of Viewer’s Choice!
