## Task 8 Email

__Subject: Re: Application for Volunteer Ball Kids__

Dear Gilbert Bayo,

On behalf of Event Horizon, I am writing to inform you the decision regarding the volunteer ball kids for the Victoria Cup as well as what Event Horizon can do to contribute to your charity. Unfortunately, our company have decided not to choose your charity to provide us the volunteer ball kids. One reason is that we require our volunteer ball kids to speak both English and Cantonese but according to your charity’s information, some children in your sanctuary can speak English but very few speak Cantonese. Another reason is that the volunteer ball kids should be at least 11 years old, but the children only stay in your center up to 10 years old, so the age criterion for the volunteer ball kids is not met.

In order to thank you for your charity’s interest in providing volunteer ball kids for the Victoria Cup, we will provide 50 complimentary tickets for your center’s children so that they can see the matches live. On top of that, we have managed to invite Lara Taranova, who is the highest ranking player in Victoria Cup, will visit the charity during the tournament. In addition, Lara is generous enough to offer a donation of $500, 000 HKD to your charity so that your center can convert a room into a gym, which she would like it to be called Lara Taranova Gym.

Although we regret not picking your charity as the provider for the volunteer ball kids for Victoria Cup, we would still like to collaborate with your charity in future events. Also, we hope you can consider our offer to contribute to your charity mentioned above as we would love the children in your center to share the excitement of Victoria Cup and have a new gym to participate in healthy sports activities. If you have any questions regarding our decision and contributions, please contact me via email.

Regards,<br/>
Nico Lin<br/>

## Task 9: Letter to The Editor

Dear Editor,

On behalf of Event Horizon, I am writing to respond to the issues mentioned in by Ms. Geeta Singh’s letter on 24th April, 2021.

First of all, I want to start by pointing out the issue regarding the majority of seats being reserved for corporate sponsors and their guests is not true. In fact, only 12% of tickets go to corporate sponsors.

With regard to the fact that a number of corporate sponsor seats were left empty last year, we have decided to introduce a new policy this year so that corporate sponsor will lose their ticket if they do not arrive within 60 minutes of the start of play. This policy should make it more fair for everyone.

In terms of real fans not getting hold of tickets, we have learned our lesson, so we have come up a solution to allow members of local tennis clubs to get priority in booking tickets. On top of that, we will set up a Fanzone this year so that real fans who cannot book a ticket can still turn up and get a ticket number as they enter the Fanzone. When our staff noticed some of the seats are not claimed and confirmed that the seats will not be occupied, those seats will be given to fans with the lowest ticket numbers in the Fanzone.

Last but not least, in order to prevent the issue of having fans who talk through the matches, we have decided to set up a new rule so that fans who talk through the matches will be removed from the venue this year.

Based on what I have mentioned above, I want to point out that the Event Horizon has learned from the issues mentioned in Ms Singh’s letter, and we want to assure her and everyone that we have come up with solutions to make sure this year’s Victoria Cup will be more fair and enjoyable.

Yours faithfully,<br/>
Nico Lin<br/>
Event Horizon<br/>

## Task 10: Internal Email

__Subject:  The Designs of Promotional Poster for Victoria Cup__

Dear Alfred Roi,

As the Victoria Cup is approaching fast, I know you and your colleagues have been working very hard to create all sorts of PR related content and materials, so I hope this email finds you well. However, I’m writing to share with you some issues we have found in the promotional poster and ask you to redesign it.

First of all, my team and I want to thank you and your team for designing the promotional poster for us. Unfortunately, we have received some negative feedback regarding the poster as 88% of the people in an online poll suggested that they think the poster is inappropriate. Based on the feedback, people think that the poster should focus on sporting talents or achievements, not appearance. 

Regarding the slogan, we learned that it should not suggest female tennis players to play tennis “like a man.” Also, the slogan should not suggest women to look a certain way. In terms of the player in the poster, we believe that the player in the poster should be the highest-ranking player, so the poster should feature Lara Taranova instead of Suzie Gilmour since Lara is the highest ranking player in Victoria Cup. Also, the poster should show Lara in action instead of posing like a model. 

In addition, the poster should include the sponsor’s logo and slogan as well. Moreover, since the current poster does not align with the sponsor’s aim and vision, the sponsor is considering withdrawing their sponsorship. As a result, we really hope that you and your team can redesign the poster so that we can save our reputation. 

Again, we appreciate your effort in creating the promotional poster for us, but given the feedback and issues mentioned above, I hope you and your team can redesign the poster for us. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing the redesigned version of the poster. 

Best regards,<br/>
Nico Lin
