## Task 6 Email

To: Kim Ross
Subject: Request for Changes on Plaza Hotel’s Advertisement

Dear Mr Ross,

Thank you for your interest in advertising Plaza Hotel in our next issue. However, I’m writing to inform you that we have discovered some problems in your advertisement that needs to be changed and remind you the submission deadline as well as the first payment date.

Regarding the problems in the advertisement, your advertisement is supposed to be a half-page advert, and the word limit for half-page advertisements is 50-70. However, the word count of your advertisement is over 80, so please reduce the words in your advertisement ot around 50 to 70. Besides, it would be better if you can include a picture of one of the rooms of Plaza Hotels instead of the current photo you submitted. Moreover, the room prices are missing from the advertisement, so please add the room prices when you submit it again. In addition, we need the contact details and company registration number, so please add the website address, business address, and your company registration number in the advertisement.

In terms of submission deadline and first payment date, the deadline for advertisement submission is 30th April, and the patment for all advertisements should be 50% one week before the issue is published and the remaining 50% afterward. If you have any questions about the advertisement requirement or payment, please let me know and I am more than happy to help you. Thank you again for your interest in advertising your hotel with Asia Life.

Best regards, <br/>
Marty Poon <br/>
Assistant <br/>

Experience a Unique and Memorable Stay in Some of the Most Unusual Hotels

If you’re tired of staying in a normal hotel for your holidays, we totally understand. That’s why this week we feature some of the unusual hotels in the world that will give you a totally different and unique experience. Do you want to know what makes them unusual? If so, read on!

**Ice Hotel**

The very first unusual hotel that we would like to introduce is the Ice Hotel in Norway. What’s special about the Ice hotel? Well, everything is made of ice in the hotel. You may think it’d be really cold inside because it’s made of ice, but in fact, it is actually not cold inside. More importantly, you don’t need to worry about the colde weather because the staff actually make sure the customers have lots of warm coats to wear. If you want to experience the ice hotel yourself, please remember that it only opens in winter.

**Prison Hotel**

The second unusual hotel on our list is the prison hotel in Autralia. When you stay in the prison hotel, you will sleep in a prison cell at night just like a prisoner. But don’t worry, you will have a key for your cell so that you’re not locked up inside the cell. Moreover, you can learn about the interesting history of the prison. On top of that, guests of the prison hotel have to cook dinner together in the prison kitchen and share an unforgettable meal together.

**The Beacon Hotel**

Last but not least, we want to share about the lighthouse hotel called the Beacon. It’s located near Lochinver in Scotland, and hotel guests can experience what it’s like to stay in a lighthouse. The rooms are round, and you can enjoy the fantastic scenery during your stay. Moreover, the environment is peaceful and quiet. What’s more is that it’s a great place to watch the bird life. The Beacon opens all year round, so you can visit it anytime you like.

**Which one do you want to try?**

After learning about our picks for the unusual hotels, which one would you like to experience? If you ever stayed at one of these hotels, we would love to hear from you about your experience. Thank you for reading.
