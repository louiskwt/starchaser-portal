__A Brief Summary for the Initial Concept Plan for the Golden Flower Adventure Mall__

The following is a summary of our staff’s feedback for the initial concept plan for the Golden Flower Adventure Mall.

According to the inputs from our staff, the waterfall, the sailing ship as well as the lake should remain in place while the castle should be removed since it does not align well with the overall jungle adventure theme. (Besides that, our staff commented that all the features presented in the plan are practical.)*

With regard to the waterfall, however, our staff suggested that the height should be reduced from 40 to 30 meters so that clouds will not form as they did previously in Highland Adventure Center in the UK, which caused a power failure.

While the ship should be kept, the shops on the ship should be taken out because the sailing ship cannot fit both restaurants and shops. In terms of the lake, it should be turned into an aquarium as our staff proposed a brilliant idea to add a swimming pool under the waterfall and right next to the aquarium so that swimmers can swim next to the sea animals.

To develop more features, our staff recommended to include ziplines over the swimming pool and provide abseiling on the sides of the swimming pool for the general public, which is something that has never been done before.

Overall, our staff agreed that the mall is going to be a fascinating space for a wide range of activities. This is the end of the summary.

__Dragon Peak’s Commitment to the Environment in Hong Kong__

Since 2005, Dragon Peak Properties (DPP) has been the envy of all developers in Hong Kong because of what our company has done to safeguard the natural environment in Hong Kong. Below, you will find an overview about our effort to protect the environment, our recent achievement as well as the latest work that we have performed to protect the orchids and the butterflies on Golden Flower Island.

At the beginning of 2000, FPP began to invest in green construction methods, starting at around 2 billion Hong Kong dollars. Since then, the amount of money we spent on Green Construction methods increased gradually from 2 billion to 5.5 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2015, turning ourselves into the development company which invested the most in Green Construction techniques.

Our commitment to invest in green construction methods has recently been recognized by the Tai Shing Conservation Institute as DPP was awarded the 1st prize for the Green House Development Awards 2016.

Besides spending a significant amount of money on environmentally friendly building technologies, DPP is also putting a lot of effort into protecting the orchids and the butterflies on Golden Flower Island. While developing the Golden FLower Adventure Mall, DPP immediately recognized the importance of safeguarding the Golden Dragon Tail Butterflies as well as the extremely rare Splash of Gold Orchid which can only be found on Golden Flower Island. Rather than keeping 50% of the land on the island as protected area for nature park as specified by the Hong Kong government, DPP is ambitious enough to reserve 70% of the entire area on the island for nature park. Further, DPP has taken an extra step to put up a wall of vegetation to keep out both noise and light pollution. In the future, when the mall opens, no vehicles will be allowed and no roads will be built on the island. That way the butterflies will not be distrubed.

All in all, the information presented above shows you that we are an environmentally friendly development company.
