<div align="center">

Survey on Barriers to Communication

</div>

The following is an introduction for the online survey, and it aims to provide the background of various communication barriers experienced by people in Hong Kong.

First of all, we need to define barrier. A barrier is something that stops something from happening. In terms of communication barrier, it refers to something that prevents communication from happening.

In Hong Kong, noise is one of the communication barrier. People can get angry in a noisy environment, and the noise can increase stress levels and blood pressure. What is worse is that people can miss important information when communicating in a noisy environment.

In addition to noise, time barrier is another communication barrier. People experience this barrier because the pace of life in Hong Kong is so fast. On top of that,, customers can lose customers due to time barrier when people can get frustrated while trying to communicate.

Last but not least, not listening can also be a communication barrier because it makes people feel that what they say isn’t important. Moreover, people feel there is a wall between them and other people when people interrupting others with what they think the other person is going to say.

After learning all the information about barriers to communications, you can now proceed to the survey and fill out all the questions to your best knowledge.

Body Language

Eye contect

With eye contact, we have to be careful because eye contact can mean different things in different cultures. In some cultures, prolonged eye contact can mean that you want a fight. In other cultures, eye contact can mean you’re interested in what the person’s saying while it can also mean you’re romantically interested in some cultures. That being said, you should become aware of what you do with your eyes and adapt to the situation.

Arms

When it comes to how you position your arms, you should pay attention to how folding your arms can mean different things. A survey indicates that some people will think you’re really listening or agreeing if you fold your arms. However, the survey also shows that folding your arms can mean you’re rejecting or disagreeing. Thus, the best advice is to revert to a neutral position with your hands loosely clasped in front of yourself.

Standing

How you stand can affect the impression you create when giving permissions. A researcher finds that candidates can fail a job interview because of the way they stand. When you stand, putting hands on your hips makes you look over-confident and arrogant. On top of that, you should relax your arms and let your arms hang by your side while standing.

Practical Difficulities Faced by Newcommers in Hong Kong

</div>

Even though Hong Kong is a great place and has a lot of positive things, newcomers in Hong Kong still face a wide range of practical difficulties in their daily lives. In view of this, this article aims to shed light on the practical difficulties faced by people from different countries and provide information on the available help they can get from our community.

To start with, many newcomers experience difficulties when it comes to finding a school for their children because they have trouble filling out the long applications forms from Education Bureau. Because of that, Cultural Commons offer school application filling services for free for newcomers.

Besides applying for school, children from different cultures struggle to make new friends in Hong Kong. To help them, Cultural Commons offer youth clubs and sports team for children to make new friends while participating in sports and other activities.

In addition, newcomers also report having difficulties in finding somewhere to live in Hong Kong. Fortunately, an estate agent in Kwun Tong provides a commission-free service to help newcomers find somewhere to live.

Furthermore, newcomers also have trouble finding medical care. The good news is that four doctors in Mong Kok are offering free clinics once a week.

Other than that, finding free legal advice is also a difficulty for newcomers. Given this situation, two local lawyers offer pro bono services to newcomers through community-based legal advice scheme.

In conclusion, while practical difficulties are faced by newcomers, our community is doing our best to offer assistance to help newcomers adapt to the life in Hong Kong.
