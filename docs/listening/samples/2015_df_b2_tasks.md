## Task 8 Email to Ultimatum Products

Subject: Products for Bubblegum's Asian Tour

Dear Ms Wong,

I am writing on behalf of the North Star Artists regarding the information about the products we would like to make.

To start with, we have decided to make four products for the Asian Tour of Bubblegum in May. The first product is temporary tattoos. Since we know that the temporary tattoos that your company creates will not cause skin allergies and we don’t want temporary tattoos that can cause skin issues due to chemicals, we would like your company to help create the tattoos with the design of the Bubblegum on the Hong Kong flag.

Besides the tattoos, we want to create keychains and sofft toys for the fans. For the keychains, the material must be metal and not plastic. The soft toys should be teddy bears and pandas. Also, there should be a Bubblegum logo printed on the belly of the toys.

The last product that we want is a selection of Bubblegum T-shirts. These T-shirs should have different colours.

Since all the products mentioned above are used for Bubblegum’s Asian Tour in May, we want to order at least 20, 000 for each product, and the products have to be ready by the first week of May.

Before I finish this email, I would like to ask you to give us a quote. I look forward to hearing from you and seeing the products that your company creates. If you have any questions, please contact me for more details.

Yours sicneerely,<br/>

## Task 9 Email to The Peak Sky Deck

Dear Ms Ma,

Thank you for your response, and I am now writing to address your concerns about the filming of the music video at the Peak Sky Deck.

First of all, I want to explain the reasons why we want to flim there. As the theme of the Bubblegum’s song is places around the world, we would like to flim the music video in famous landmarks around the world. In Hong Kong, the peak sky deck is a world-famous landmark in Hong Kong, so we would like to film the music video there.

Besides, it can benefit the Peak Sky Deck and Hong Kong tourism if Bubblegum can film their music video there. According to a report, Hong Kong’s landmarks are not as popular as the ones in New York. But after Bubblegum filmed the music video there and when people from around the world see that, the Sky Peak Deck will become more famous around the world. Moreover, a great percentage of tourists from the USA and Europe enjoy visiting landmarks when they travel to a foreign country. Therefore, allowing Bubblegum to film in the Peak Sky Deck not only can increase its popularity, but also attract visitors from different countries to visis Hong Kong.

In terms of your concerns about the actual filming, I can provide you with more details.Regarding noise levels, we would only use a small CD player when filming in order to keep it quiet. For security issues, we will keep the filming secret, so no one will know about it or show up in the Sky Peak Deck. On top of that, we will film from midnight after business hours, and It only takes 6 hours to film so we won’t affect the business operation of the Sky Peak Deck. As for heavy equipment, we will only bring a camera (60 kg) crane and lights with stands (45 kg).

Based on what I have mentioned, I hope you can allow us to film the music video in the Sky Peak Deck as it will benefit the Sky Peak Deck and the Hong Kong tourism. I look forward to hearing the decision from you.Thank you.

Yours sincerely,<br/>
Starsky Cheung<br/>
