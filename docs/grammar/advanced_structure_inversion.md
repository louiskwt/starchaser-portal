## 疑問句（Question Sentences）

🔸 正常語序係咁：

👉 You know what I mean.

🔹 但係變成疑問句，就要倒裝：

👉 Do you know what I mean?

👉 You have finished your homework.（你做完功課啦）

變成疑問句就係：
👉 Have you finished your homework?


📌 我哋將助動詞 do 放咗去主語 you 前面，形成倒裝句。

## 強調否定副詞開頭

📌 用法：

當句子一開始用咗啲 否定副詞，例如：

- never（從未）

- rarely（很少）

- not only（不單止）

- hardly（幾乎唔）

咁我哋就要用倒裝句嚟強調句子。


例子一：

👉正常語序：I have never seen such a picture.

👉 倒裝句：Never have I seen such a picture.

例子二：

👉 正常語序：I rarely go to the gym.

👉 倒裝句：Rarely do I go to the gym.

例子三：

👉正常語序：I have studied abroad in America, and I have also worked there.

👉 倒裝句：Not only have I studied abroad in America, but I have also worked there.

👉 正常語序：The staff refused to change the room, and he also ignored my complaints.

👉 倒裝句：Not only did the staff refuse to change the room, but he also ignored my complaints

📌 記住，呢啲否定副詞一擺喺句首，就要將助動詞放前面！

### 常見錯誤：Not only 用法

❌ 錯誤寫法：

Not only studied abroad, but I have also worked there. ❌

（錯喺冇倒裝主語同冇助動詞）

✅ 正確寫法：

Not only have I studied abroad, but I have also worked there. ✅

原句： I have not only studied abroad, but I have also worked there.

📌 重點：not only 放喺句首，就一定要倒裝，助動詞放前面，主語跟住。

## ✨if-句 倒裝（更正式）

📌 用法：
想令條件句（If-sentences）聽落更正式、更有文采，我哋可以省略 "if"，然後倒裝句子。

例子1：

👉正常語序：If I had done my homework, I wouldn't have been punished.

👉 倒裝句：Had I done my homework, I wouldn't have been punished.

例子2：

👉 If you should need any help, please let me know.

👉 倒裝句：*Should you need any help, please let me know.

📌 呢啲句式，喺正式寫作（例如 report、proposal）用出嚟，會係加分位！

## 🧠總結

今日我哋學咗三大類倒裝句，再加一個必學嘅陷阱提醒！：

疑問句用倒裝：Do you...? / Have you...?

否定副詞開頭要倒裝：Never have I..., Rarely do I...

正式 if-句倒裝：Had I..., Were I..., Should you...

Not only 開頭記得倒裝，唔好中伏！
