## ✏️因果關係 (because / as / since / so)

👉 because / since / as 全部都可以解釋為「因為」

不過語氣會有少少唔同： because 比較直接；since 同 as 比較書面。

📘例子：

- I stayed home because it was raining. （我留喺屋企，因為出面落雨。）

- Since you're here, let's start the meeting. （既然你到咗，我哋開始開會啦。）

- I was absent yesterday, as I was sick.（因為我生病了，所以我你法出席。）

👉  so （所以）

帶出結果； 用於句子中間，要跟 comma

📘例子：

- He was tired, so he went to bed.（佢攰，所以佢去瞓覺。）

- You’re right, so I’m going to change that. (你啱呀，所以我馬上去修改。)

## 轉折關係 (but / although / even though)

👉  but 但是

📘例子：

- I like football, but I don't play it often. （我鍾意足球，但係唔係成日踢。）

👉  although / even though （雖然  /  即使)

📘例子：

- Although it was cold, she didn’t wear a jacket.  （雖然好凍，但佢冇著褸。）

- Even though he studied, he failed the test.  （即使佢有讀書，佢都唔合格。）

 📌 although 同 even though 都解「雖然」，但 even though 語氣更強。

### Common Mistakes with Although / Even though

📌 although 同 even though 是不會跟 but 一同使用

例子：

- Although it’s cold, but I don’t want to wear a jacket. ❌

- Although it’s cold, I don’t want to wear a jacket. ✅

雖然天氣凍，但我不想穿外套

👉  When 當

📘例子：

- When I was young, I played video games every day.（當我細個嘅時候，我每日打機。） 

When 可以放前面或者中間都得： 

- I played video games every day when I was young.
