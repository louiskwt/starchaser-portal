In-Store Event

To attract customers to our pop-up shop, we will host an exciting event called "Upcycle Your Trash Workshop". This interactive workshop will teach customers how to repurpose common household waste items, such as glass jars, plastic bottles, and old clothing, into useful or decorative objects. For example, participants can learn how to turn an old T-shirt into a reusable shopping bag or transform a glass jar into a stylish plant holder.

The workshop will be led by our experienced team and is designed to be fun, engaging, and family-friendly. All necessary materials and tools will be provided, and participants can take home their upcycled creations. Additionally, attendees will receive exclusive discounts on our eco-friendly products during the event. By hosting this workshop, we aim to raise awareness about waste reduction and inspire customers to adopt sustainable habits in their daily lives.
