# DSE 2021 Paper 2 Part A Speech Sample

This’s Chris from the school fair committee, and today I have an exciting announcement to make. Our Annual School Fair is just around the corner! It’ll be held on Saturday, 29th May 2021, from 12 PM to 4 PM right here at our school campus. This’s one of the biggest events of the year, and we want all of you to be part of it!


Our committee members and I have been working diligently to organise a wide variety of activities for everyone to enjoy. If you’re a foodie, you should definitely check out the food stalls in our covered playground and grap some homemade Hong Kong snacks such as egg tarts, egg waffles, and giant fish ball, which will be prepared by the amazing members from our Parents and Teacher Association. After eating a lot of great food, you’ll feel energised for some actions, right? You can test your skills and luck at the game booths set up in the activity rooms and classroom on the first floor. You win amazing prizes by solving sudoku puzzles, competing in indoor archery, playing Monopoly against our teachers.

What if you’re not interesting in games? Don’t worry! Even if you don’t enjoy playing game and prefer something more artistic, we’ve got you covered. This year, thanks to Ms. Wong and our lovely Art Club members, we will have an arts and crafts section in our art room, where you can create your personalised sand art and craft your unique fragrance. In addition, we will also have student performances in the main hall, so get ready to support your friends as they sing, dance, and showcase their talents. Additionally, you should chack out the displays of student work outside of the hall and appreciate the creativity and hard work of your classmates. Last but not least, one of the highlights of the fair is the Alumni Football Match, where past and present students will compete in an exciting game.

To ensure the success of the School Fair. we need volunteers to help us. If you’re interested in setting up booths, managing activities, or assisting with performances, please email chriswong@hkbs.edu.hk as soon as possible. This’s a great opportunity to gain experience, contribute to our school community, and have fun at the same time!

Tickets are only $10, and everyone is welcome, so invite your friends and family! Mark your calendars and get ready for a fantastic day! Thank you, and I hope to see all of you at the fair!
