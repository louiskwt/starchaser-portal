# DSE 2018 Paper 2 Part A Sample

Dear parents and guardians of all 6A students,

As the class teacher of 6A, I am writing to inform you about our school’s upcoming class trip, which is scheduled to take place on April 13 from 10 am to 6 pm. In the following paragraphs, you shall find all the necessary information regarding the trip.

For this year’s school trip, I will be taking the entire class to the renowned Sky100—the highest observation deck in Hong Kong—and the main objective of the trip is twofold. On the one hand, this trip can provide an opportunity for students to take a much-needed study break before the imminent DSE exams and spend a peaceful day with their classmates while enjoying the gorgeous view of the Victoria Harbor as well as the Kowloon Peninsula. More importantly, the trip to Sky100 is the final chance for the whole class to have a group activity, so students can create some long-lasting and treasurable memories one last time before graduation.

With regard to the arrangement of the trip, I would start by sharing some good news with you about the cost and transportation. The admission fee for the Sky100 is HKD 150.00, and no student discount is offered. Fortunately, our school’s Alumni Foundation is generous enough to sponsor our trip so that the students do not have to pay for the entrance fees. On top of that, our school’s Parents and Teachers Association decided in the last meeting that the association is going to offer free transportation services between Sky100 and our school by chartering a school bus for the students.

In terms of lunch, I am delighted to share with you that the students can dine in the five-star Italian restaurant located on the top floor of the Sky100. As a special treat for the students, I have decided to cover the expense myself. The motive behind my plan is that as my retirement is approaching, I want to show my appreciation for the students’ kindness and tenacity demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have already discussed my plan with the principal and sought his approval. At this stage, I am in the process of finalizing the reservation for tables as I need to know how many of the students will participate in this trip.

Based on what I have mentioned above, I hope you can consider letting your child take part in this activity. To indicate your decision, please kindly circle the options printed on the reply slip attached to this letter. Should you have any enquiries, you can reach out to me at 6543 2100 or via email at chriswong@abcschool.edu.hk.

Regards,<br/>
Chris Wong <br/>
6A Class teacher<br/>
