# DSE 2021 Paper 2 Part B Q2: Electric Vehicles Sample

Dear Editor,

Regarding the low sales of electric vehicles (EVs), I am writing to express my concerns. Despite the fact that studies have repeatedly shown that EVs produce fewer emissions and contribute less to climate change than petrol-powered cars, it is alarming that less than 3% of all vehicles sold in 2020 worldwide were electric. This raises an important question: why are consumers still hesitant to make the switch? In the following paragraphs, I am going to discuss the reasons behind the low sales of EVs and offer some suggestions on what can be done to attract people to adopt EVs.

One of the primary reasons for the slow adoption of EVs is their high upfront cost. Although EVs are becoming more affordable over time, they are still significantly more expensive than traditional petrol cars. Many consumers are discouraged by the hefty price tag, even if they acknowledge the long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Furthermore, government subsidies and incentives for EV buyers remain insufficient in many countires, making it financially impractical for the average consumer to choose an electric car over a petrol-powered one. Given the high cost and a lack of subsidies, people will not have the financial incentives to opt for EVs when they decide to purchase a car. 

Another major barrier is the lack of charging infrastructure. Unlike petrol stations, which are readily available in most urban and rural areas, charging stations for EVs are still relatively scarce. In cities like Hong Kong, where many residents live in high-rise buildings without private parking spaces, the difficulty of charging an EV discourages potential buyers. The fear of running out of battery power without access to a nearby charging station—often referred to as "range anxiety"—is a significant concern, particularly for those who frequently travel long distances. Due to the lack of charging infrastructure and the anxiety it may bring, people have very little reason to adopt EVs.

Moreover, the limited variety of EV models available on the market plays a role in the slow adoption rate. Traditional car manufacturers offer a wide range of petrol and hybrid vehicles—ranging from sports cars and luxury sedan to minivan and family cars. By offering various models, the traditional car companies can cater for different consumer needs. In comparison, the selection of EVs remains relatively small. For instance, the EV giant Tesla only offers three models for their flagship EVs, namely Model X, Model Y, and Model 3. Consequently, many consumers are hesitant to switch because they cannot find an electric vehicle that meets their preferences, whether in terms of size, performance, or design.


To encourage more people to transition to electric vehicles, several measures should be taken. First and foremost, governments must introduce stronger financial incentives, such as larger subsidies, tax reductions, and interest-free loans for EV buyers. These policies would make EVs more accessible to and affordable for a broader range of consumers and help bridge the price gap between electric and petrol-powered cars. Knowing the subsidies, tax reductions and interest-free loans one can get, potential car buyers can be financially incentivised to opt for an EV instead of its petrol-powered counterpart. 

Second, expanding the charging infrastructure is crucial at the moment. Governments and private companies should invest in building more fast-charging stations in convenient locations such as shopping malls, public car parks, and residential areas. In addition, policies should be implemented to encourage property developers to install EV charging points in new buildings, making it easier for residents to charge their vehicles at home. On top of that, the governments all over the world should encourage more utility companies to partner with private enterprise to provide EV charger rental service for EV owners. In Hong Kong, the Smart Charge EV charger rental service offered by CLP, a utility company, and HKT, a private telecommunication enterprise, provides a case in point. With the increase of charging stations and more accesses to EV charging services, people will find owning EV less inconvenient and thus feel less worried about adopting the EVs.

Furthermore, car manufacturers should work on producing a wider variety of EV models to cater to different consumer needs. For instance, EV companies can learn from the design of the EV sports car model Taycan designed by Porsche as well as Lexus’s all-electric SUV model RZ.  By offering vehicles with different sizes and features, more people may find an EV that suits their lifestyle and needs. On top of that, public awareness campaigns should also be launched to educate consumers about the long-term financial benefits and environmental impact of driving an electric car since many people remain misinformed about EVs. EV makers can collaborate with YouTubers and celebrities to create videos about how EVs can enhance their travel or driving experience and help them save money while creating less carbon footprint on each drive. Addressing these misconceptions could help increase demand.

In conclusion, while electric vehicles offer a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to petrol cars, various challenges—including high costs, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of model variety—are preventing widespread adoption. However, with stronger financial incentives, improved infrastructure, and wider range of options, we can encourage more people to make the switch. Only by addressing these barriers can we ensure a greener and more sustainable future for transportation.

Yours faithfully,<br/>
