## About Hong Kong Adventure Farm

Welcome to Hong Kong Adventure Farm (HKAF)! If you’re reading this booklet, you’re likely to be a first-time visitor. If so, you’re in for a treat because you’re goind to enjoy all the thrill that we have reserved for you. But now, let me give you some information about this farm. Established in 2010, HKAF is the largest farm every built in Hong Kong. Our founders chose to build this fam in Sai Kung because this area is surrounded by beautiful landscape but still easily accessible by the public. The entire farm is connected by a well-planned railway system which aims to facilitate easy navigation inside the famr while providing a wide range of activities to maximise your enjoyment. For more information about the things to do and see, please read on!

## Top three things to see and do.

First of all, you should not miss the chance to see a real waterfall while you’re exploring the farm. When you depart from the Main Station, which is where the entrance is located, you’ll first arrive at the Waterfall Station in about 10 minutes. The waterfall is right next to the station. Once you alight from the train, you can spot the designated photo-taking area to take not only a few stunning pictures of the waterfall but also some selfies with the waterfall. Meanwhile, you can enjoy the splash of water flying down the waterfall. In case you worry about getting wet, please don’t because we’ve got you covered. We offer free re-usable raincoat for each visitor. Just remember to take one from the Waterfall Station.

After visiting the waterfall, you may want to spend more time with water. After all, not everyone can have a chance to participate in water sports or activity. That’s why you should head to Lake Side Station by the train and have fun doing kayaking. We rent out kayak to our visitors at an affordable price (HKD $50 for 3 hours). While kayaking around the lake, you’ll bew  immersed in a tranquil environment. Meanwhile, you can have a chance to spot some of the animals in our farm such as deers, goats, exotic birds—you name it.

Last but not least, with a peace of mind you gained from kayaking and seeiing adorable animals, you should be a bit hungry and ready for a feast. Then, let’s hop on the train again and travel to the Farmer Market Station where you can experience a fine-dining experience at our award-winning restaurant next to the station. In that eatery, you can taster mouth-watering and delicate dishes prepared by using locally grown vegetables and farm-raised animal products sourced directly from our farm. Whether you’re a foodie or not, you should definitely dine in that restaurant to have a fresh and delicious meal while being surrounded by nature.

These are the top three things that we highly recommend you to do and see in the famr, but our farm still have a lot more exiting places and activities for you to explore. So, what’re you waiting for? Just get on the train and kick off your adventure in our farm now!
