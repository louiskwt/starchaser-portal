# DSE 2024 Paper 2 Part A: Complaint Email

Dear Manager,

After seeing the advertisement about the room with a balcony and ocean view on your website, I booked a one-night stay in anticipation of a delightful experience for my mother, but unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations based on the information presented on your website and now I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent stay.

First and foremost, the room I was provided was significantly different from what was advertised. The photo promised a king-size bed, a stunning ocean view of the Victoria Harbour, and a beautiful balcony. However, upon arrival, I found the room to be much smaller, with a limited view that was obstructed by nearby buildings, and there was no balcony at all. This was particularly disheartening as I intended to surprise my mom with a beautiful view of the ocean to make our stay memorable.

Additionally, I encountered multiple issues during our stay. The air conditioning in the room was not functioning effectively, leaving us quite uncomfortable throughout the night. Furthermore, the Wi-Fi connection was weak and unreliable, which made it difficult for us to communicate and share our experience with family back home.

To add to my disappointment, the room was supposed to be a non-smoking one; however, there was a persistent smell of cigarette smoke that lingered in the air, making it quite unpleasant.

I kindly request that you address these issues to ensure future guests have a better experience. A partial refund or a discount on a future stay would be appreciated, as I believe this would show your commitment to customer satisfaction. Moreover, I advise you to make sure the information shown on your website is as accurate as possible. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Chris Wong
