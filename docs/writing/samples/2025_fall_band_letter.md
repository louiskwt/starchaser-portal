# Fall 2025 Band Letter Writing

## Level 5 Sample (Louis’s Vomit Draft)

Dear Blue Day,

Last week, your band announced the upcoming world tour, and during the tour, your band is scheduled to perform live in many Asian cities. But unfortunately, Hong Kong is not one of them. As a devoted fan and the president of the Hong Kong Blue Day Fan Club, I’m writing this letter to share my thoughts on Hong Kong not being one of your stops in the worldwide tour and express my hope for you to reconsider your decision.

To begin with, Hong Kong has been experiencing a revival for rock music since last year as more and more people get to listen to rock bands from all over the world playing live in Hong Kong. As Mary, our beloved guitarist and lead vocalist of Blue Day, mentioned in her answer to a fan asking why Hong Kong was not selected as one of the destinations for this world tour, you all have been told that the hardcore rock music is not a genre that is popular in Hong Kong. However, I want to clarify that this must be yesterday’s news because, thanks to the Mega Event Economy policy, our government has been putting a tremendous effort to invite musicians and artists across different genres to perform in Hong Kong in order to enrich and expand the residents’ musical taste. Because of that, many other hardcore rock acts from America and the United Kingdoms—such as Heavy Duty Machine, Galaxy Train, and Hotplay, just to name a few—have either played in Hong Kong as a part of their world tour or performed live in our music festivals like the Clockenflap. As Hong Kongers have more exposure to rock music, the number of rock fans in Hong Kong has also increased significantly from around 16% of Hong Kong residents in 2023 to about 48% of Hong Kongers in 2025, according to a music survey conducted by South China Morning Post. That being said, the signature 90’s style hardcore rock and the melodramatic lyrics that make Blue Day unique will definitely receive a heart-felt welcome from the Hong Kong rock fans.

Besides the revival of rock music, the Blue Day fanbase in Hong Kong is growing stronger and stronger every day because your band has been using your music to build a platform to spread empowering messages to fans and advocate for better mental health support. A few years ago, when I first took the initiative to set up the fan club, we only had around 100 active members. But today, the number has grown to 1,121 members. What’s more important is that unlike other band’s fans who only focus on their bands or idols, we are highly motivated to empower others and act as an advocate for mental health because we are deeply touched by the messages from your music. As the president of the fan club in the city, I have witnessed firsthand how your music inspires the listeners to not only join the fan club but also volunteer at local non-governmental organisations which serve people with mental health issues. In fact, recently our fan club has come up with an initiative to set up a philanthropic campaign called “With You”, which is named after your first song on self-acceptance, and our campaign aims to sponsor the establishment of mental health hotline at various community centers in Hong Kong. Given the growth of the fan club as well as our active pursuits to advocate for better mental health, your performance in Hong Kong would only make them feel more motivated to spread the messages about mental health and work harder to make our community a better place for promoting mental healh, and all the fans in Hong Kong would not let you down if you decided to add an additional show in Hong Kong.

In addition to the growing fandom in Hong kong, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how much Blue Day means to me. Few years ago, while I was studying for the high-pressure college entrance exams during the covid pandemic, I felt very depressed and hopeless because schools were closed and I couldn’t hang out with my friends during that difficult time. But fortunately, I came across two of your songs “With You” and “Stronger Together”, and the upbeat rhythm and powerful vocal light up my mood and ignite my hope for a better and brighter future. On top of that, the lyrics from those songs encouraged me to be resilient and tenacious even during difficult times. More importantly, your songs reminded me the importance of seeking allies in adversity because we cannot fight alone when facing uphill battles like overcoming mental health issues or getting through the pandemic. Shortly after listening to your songs, I reach out to my friends via Zoom and social media, and we built up the camaraderie that propelled us to get through the difficult period together. Looking back, I can confidently say that if I had not discovered your music back then, I would not have done well in my college entrance exam and remained hopeful for the future, not to mention getting into university to study psychology and running a fan club that advocates for better mental health in Hong Kong. Although I cannot speak for all the fans, I’m positive that most of the Hong Kongers become your fans, not just because they liked rock music, but because your songs resonated with them deeply especially during the difficult times. Because your music has accompanied us through all the ups and downs, we genuinely hope that your band would have another discussion about whether Hong Kong should be added as one of the destinations during the Asia leg of your world.

Based on what I have mentioned above, I hope I have managed to cast out the doubt that you have about your music not being popular in Hong Kong, show you how much impact your music has for our fans, and share with you how much we would love to see Blue Day play a live show in Hong Kong. If your band decided play in Hong Kong, we would sing along to every song you play and scream our lungs out so that your band’s message would be heard loud and clear in our city. Thank you for reading this letter, and regardless of your final decision, all the fans, including myself, will support your band forever. To close the letter, I wish your band all the best and success with your upcoming world tour!

Best regards,
Chris Wong
A devoted fan from Hong Kong

Dear Blue Day,

As the president of your devoted Hong Kong Fan Club, I am writing to implore you to reconsider the omission of our city from your upcoming world tour. The belief that your music lacks an audience here is a painful misconception, and I hope to show you the passionate, thriving community that awaits you.

Contrary to what you’ve been told, Hong Kong is experiencing a rock music renaissance. Driven by pro-arts government policies, our city has recently hosted major international rock acts, including Hotplay and Galaxy Train, to sold-out crowds at festivals like Clockenflap. This exposure has ignited the public's appetite; a recent South China Morning Post survey reveals a surge in rock listenership, from 16% in 2023 to nearly 50% today. Your signature 90s sound would not just be welcomed; it would be celebrated.

Beyond market size, your Hong Kong fanbase is one of the most dedicated and mission-driven you have. Inspired by your powerful advocacy for mental health, our fan club has grown tenfold. More importantly, we have translated your message into action. We recently launched “With You,” a philanthropic initiative named after your song on self-acceptance, which funds mental health hotlines in local community centres. A live performance in Hong Kong would galvanize these efforts and powerfully amplify the message of hope you champion.

On a personal level, your music was my lifeline. During the isolating pandemic and the immense pressure of university entrance exams, your songs “With You” and “Stronger Together” were more than just music; they were anthems of resilience. They inspired me to seek camaraderie, persevere, and ultimately pursue a degree in psychology. My story is not unique. Your music resonates here because it offers strength in adversity, and we yearn to share that collective energy with you in person.

Hong Kong is not just a potential market; it is a city full of fans whose lives you have already changed. We are ready to sing every word and prove that this is where you belong. Thank you for your consideration. We wish you a successful tour, hoping it will include us.

Best regards,
Chris Wong
President, Hong Kong Blue Day Fan Club
