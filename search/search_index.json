A barrier is something that stops something from happening. In terms of communication barrier, it refers to something that prevents communication from happening.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, noise is one of the communication barrier. People can get angry in a noisy environment, and the noise can increase stress levels and blood pressure. What is worse is that people can miss important information when communicating in a noisy environment.</p> <p>In addition to noise, time barrier is another communication barrier. People experience this barrier because the pace of life in Hong Kong is so fast. On top of that,, customers can lose customers due to time barrier when people can get frustrated while trying to communicate.</p> <p>Last but not least, not listening can also be a communication barrier because it makes people feel that what they say isn\u2019t important. Moreover, people feel there is a wall between them and other people when people interrupting others with what they think the other person is going to say.</p> <p>After learning all the information about barriers to communications, you can now proceed to the survey and fill out all the questions to your best knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"listening/samples/2012_df_b2_tasks/#task-9-advice-page-for-website","title":"Task 9 Advice Page for Website","text":"Body Language   <p>Eye contect</p> <p>With eye contact, we have to be careful because eye contact can mean different things in different cultures.

In other cultures, eye contact can mean you\u2019re interested in what the person\u2019s saying while it can also mean you\u2019re romantically interested in some cultures. That being said, you should become aware of what you do with your eyes and adapt to the situation.</p> <p>Arms</p> <p>When it comes to how you position your arms, you should pay attention to how folding your arms can mean different things. A survey indicates that some people will think you\u2019re really listening or agreeing if you fold your arms.

That\u2019s why this week we feature some of the unusual hotels in the world that will give you a totally different and unique experience. Do you want to know what makes them unusual? If so, read on!</p> <p>Ice Hotel</p> <p>The very first unusual hotel that we would like to introduce is the Ice Hotel in Norway. What\u2019s special about the Ice hotel? Well, everything is made of ice in the hotel. You may think it\u2019d be really cold inside because it\u2019s made of ice, but in fact, it is actually not cold inside. More importantly, you don\u2019t need to worry about the colde weather because the staff actually make sure the customers have lots of warm coats to wear. If you want to experience the ice hotel yourself, please remember that it only opens in winter.</p> <p>Prison Hotel</p> <p>The second unusual hotel on our list is the prison hotel in Autralia. When you stay in the prison hotel, you will sleep in a prison cell at night just like a prisoner. But don\u2019t worry, you will have a key for your cell so that you\u2019re not locked up inside the cell. Moreover, you can learn about the interesting history of the prison. On top of that, guests of the prison hotel have to cook dinner together in the prison kitchen and share an unforgettable meal together.</p> <p>The Beacon Hotel</p> <p>Last but not least, we want to share about the lighthouse hotel called the Beacon. It\u2019s located near Lochinver in Scotland, and hotel guests can experience what it\u2019s like to stay in a lighthouse. The rooms are round, and you can enjoy the fantastic scenery during your stay. Moreover, the environment is peaceful and quiet. What\u2019s more is that it\u2019s a great place to watch the bird life. The Beacon opens all year round, so you can visit it anytime you like.</p> <p>Which one do you want to try?</p> <p>After learning about our picks for the unusual hotels, which one would you like to experience?

The first product is temporary tattoos. Since we know that the temporary tattoos that your company creates will not cause skin allergies and we don\u2019t want temporary tattoos that can cause skin issues due to chemicals, we would like your company to help create the tattoos with the design of the Bubblegum on the Hong Kong flag.</p> <p>Besides the tattoos, we want to create keychains and sofft toys for the fans. For the keychains, the material must be metal and not plastic. The soft toys should be teddy bears and pandas. Also, there should be a Bubblegum logo printed on the belly of the toys.</p> <p>The last product that we want is a selection of Bubblegum T-shirts. These T-shirs should have different colours.</p> <p>Since all the products mentioned above are used for Bubblegum\u2019s Asian Tour in May, we want to order at least 20, 000 for each product, and the products have to be ready by the first week of May.</p> <p>Before I finish this email, I would like to ask you to give us a quote.

As the theme of the Bubblegum\u2019s song is places around the world, we would like to flim the music video in famous landmarks around the world. In Hong Kong, the peak sky deck is a world-famous landmark in Hong Kong, so we would like to film the music video there.</p> <p>Besides, it can benefit the Peak Sky Deck and Hong Kong tourism if Bubblegum can film their music video there. According to a report, Hong Kong\u2019s landmarks are not as popular as the ones in New York. But after Bubblegum filmed the music video there and when people from around the world see that, the Sky Peak Deck will become more famous around the world. Moreover, a great percentage of tourists from the USA and Europe enjoy visiting landmarks when they travel to a foreign country. Therefore, allowing Bubblegum to film in the Peak Sky Deck not only can increase its popularity, but also attract visitors from different countries to visis Hong Kong.</p> <p>In terms of your concerns about the actual filming, I can provide you with more details.Regarding noise levels, we would only use a small CD player when filming in order to keep it quiet. For security issues, we will keep the filming secret, so no one will know about it or show up in the Sky Peak Deck. On top of that, we will film from midnight after business hours, and It only takes 6 hours to film so we won\u2019t affect the business operation of the Sky Peak Deck. As for heavy equipment, we will only bring a camera (60 kg) crane and lights with stands (45 kg).</p> <p>Based on what I have mentioned, I hope you can allow us to film the music video in the Sky Peak Deck as it will benefit the Sky Peak Deck and the Hong Kong tourism.

Below, you will find an overview about our effort to protect the environment, our recent achievement as well as the latest work that we have performed to protect the orchids and the butterflies on Golden Flower Island.</p> <p>At the beginning of 2000, FPP began to invest in green construction methods, starting at around 2 billion Hong Kong dollars. Since then, the amount of money we spent on Green Construction methods increased gradually from 2 billion to 5.5 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2015, turning ourselves into the development company which invested the most in Green Construction techniques.</p> <p>Our commitment to invest in green construction methods has recently been recognized by the Tai Shing Conservation Institute as DPP was awarded the 1st prize for the Green House Development Awards 2016.</p> <p>Besides spending a significant amount of money on environmentally friendly building technologies, DPP is also putting a lot of effort into protecting the orchids and the butterflies on Golden Flower Island. While developing the Golden FLower Adventure Mall, DPP immediately recognized the importance of safeguarding the Golden Dragon Tail Butterflies as well as the extremely rare Splash of Gold Orchid which can only be found on Golden Flower Island. Rather than keeping 50% of the land on the island as protected area for nature park as specified by the Hong Kong government, DPP is ambitious enough to reserve 70% of the entire area on the island for nature park. Further, DPP has taken an extra step to put up a wall of vegetation to keep out both noise and light pollution. In the future, when the mall opens, no vehicles will be allowed and no roads will be built on the island. That way the butterflies will not be distrubed.</p> <p>All in all, the information presented above shows you that we are an environmentally friendly development company.</p>"},{"location":"listening/samples/2017_df_b2_tasks/#task-10-invitation-letter","title":"Task 10: Invitation Letter","text":"<p>Dear Ms. Tse,</p> <p>My name is Norman Kwok, and I am writing on behalf of Dragon Peak Properties to invite you to the Opening Ceremony of the Golden Flower Adventure Mall on 24 December 2018.</p> <p>Since you are a keen swimmer who compete for your high school swimming team in some high-profile international meets, and love being up close and personal with all the marine animals, it would be our delight to have you to be our guest of honor at the Opening Ceremony during which you could be the first person to swim in the new pool next to the sea animals in the aquarium in Golden Flower Adventure Mall.</p> <p>As we all know that, besides being an athlete, you are passionate about protecting the sea as you serve as the spokesperson for save Hong Kong Coral Community and have spoken out about the need to look after the sea and make the ocean clean in a recent press conference.

This policy should make it more fair for everyone.</p> <p>In terms of real fans not getting hold of tickets, we have learned our lesson, so we have come up a solution to allow members of local tennis clubs to get priority in booking tickets. On top of that, we will set up a Fanzone this year so that real fans who cannot book a ticket can still turn up and get a ticket number as they enter the Fanzone. When our staff noticed some of the seats are not claimed and confirmed that the seats will not be occupied, those seats will be given to fans with the lowest ticket numbers in the Fanzone.</p> <p>Last but not least, in order to prevent the issue of having fans who talk through the matches, we have decided to set up a new rule so that fans who talk through the matches will be removed from the venue this year.</p> <p>Based on what I have mentioned above, I want to point out that the Event Horizon has learned from the issues mentioned in Ms Singh\u2019s letter, and we want to assure her and everyone that we have come up with solutions to make sure this year\u2019s Victoria Cup will be more fair and enjoyable.</p> <p>Yours faithfully, Nico Lin Project Assistant, Event Horizon</p>"},{"location":"listening/samples/2021_df_b2_tasks/#task-10-internal-email","title":"Task 10: Internal Email","text":"<p>Subject:  The Designs of Promotional Poster for Victoria Cup</p> <p>Dear Alfred Roi,</p> <p>As the Victoria Cup is approaching fast, I know you and your colleagues have been working very hard to create all sorts of PR related content and materials, so I hope this email finds you well. However, I\u2019m writing to share with you some issues we have found in the promotional poster and ask you to redesign it.</p> <p>First of all, my team and I want to thank you and your team for designing the promotional poster for us. Unfortunately, we have received some negative feedback regarding the poster as 88% of the people in an online poll suggested that they think the poster is inappropriate. Based on the feedback, people think that the poster should focus on sporting talents or achievements, not appearance. </p> <p>Regarding the slogan, we learned that it should not suggest female tennis players to play tennis \u201clike a man.\u201d Also, the slogan should not suggest women to look a certain way. In terms of the player in the poster, we believe that the player in the poster should be the highest-ranking player, so the poster should feature Lara Taranova instead of Suzie Gilmour since Lara is the highest ranking player in Victoria Cup. Also, the poster should show Lara in action instead of posing like a model. </p> <p>In addition, the poster should include the sponsor\u2019s logo and slogan as well. Moreover, since the current poster does not align with the sponsor\u2019s aim and vision, the sponsor is considering withdrawing their sponsorship. As a result, we really hope that you and your team can redesign the poster so that we can save our reputation. </p> <p>Again, we appreciate your effort in creating the promotional poster for us, but given the feedback and issues mentioned above, I hope you and your team can redesign the poster for us. If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing the redesigned version of the poster. </p> <p>Best regards, Nico Lin  Project Assistant</p>"},{"location":"listening/samples/2023_df_b2_tasks/","title":"2023 Data File B2 Samples","text":""},{"location":"listening/samples/2023_df_b2_tasks/#task-8-announcement","title":"Task 8: Announcement","text":"<p>Announcement about Teen NetChef TV Star William Puddle</p> <p>In view of the recent Puddle\u2019s cooking video, which has gone viral, we have an announcement to make regarding the mistakes shown in the video and misunderstandings that people have about the events.</p> <p>First of all, we want to acknowledge that Puddle flooded the kitchen floor because he forgot to turn off the tap.

In the following paragraphs, you shall find all the necessary information regarding the trip.</p> <p>For this year\u2019s school trip, I will be taking the entire class to the renowned Sky100\u2014the highest observation deck in Hong Kong\u2014and the main objective of the trip is twofold. On the one hand, this trip can provide an opportunity for students to take a much-needed study break before the imminent DSE exams and spend a peaceful day with their classmates while enjoying the gorgeous view of the Victoria Harbor as well as the Kowloon Peninsula. More importantly, the trip to Sky100 is the final chance for the whole class to have a group activity, so students can create some long-lasting and treasurable memories one last time before graduation.</p> <p>With regard to the arrangement of the trip, I would start by sharing some good news with you about the cost and transportation. The admission fee for the Sky100 is HKD 150.00, and no student discount is offered. Fortunately, our school\u2019s Alumni Foundation is generous enough to sponsor our trip so that the students do not have to pay for the entrance fees. On top of that, our school\u2019s Parents and Teachers Association decided in the last meeting that the association is going to offer free transportation services between Sky100 and our school by chartering a school bus for the students.</p> <p>In terms of lunch, I am delighted to share with you that the students can dine in the five-star Italian restaurant located on the top floor of the Sky100. As a special treat for the students, I have decided to cover the expense myself. The motive behind my plan is that as my retirement is approaching, I want to show my appreciation for the students\u2019 kindness and tenacity demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have already discussed my plan with the principal and sought his approval. At this stage, I am in the process of finalizing the reservation for tables as I need to know how many of the students will participate in this trip.</p> <p>Based on what I have mentioned above, I hope you can consider letting your child take part in this activity.

After reading your letter, I feel sorry to learn that your parents rejected your future plan and made you feel frustrated. Not so long ago, I\u2019ve been through a similar situation, so I can relate to how you feel. To offer you some help, I\u2019d like to give you some advice on how to deal with your situation, and hopefully you\u2019ll find this letter useful and comforting.</p> <p>To start with, I want to point out that misunderstanding is a common cause for all kinds of family problems between children and parents. As we are members of Gen Z, I bet your parents don\u2019t know much about what you like and don\u2019t like because we only feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and feelings with our friends or on social media. But because of that, our parents know very little about us. This can result in parents making wrong judgments and forming incorrect opinions about us when we sit down and discuss our thoughts with them. In my case, when I told my parents about my plan to become a writer, they thought that I only want to become a writer because of the fame I can get, which was not true at all. But in your case, your parents may think that your passion in becoming a vet will not last since it\u2019s not an easy career path.</p> <p>But you may ask, how do I know if my parents actually misunderstood me? You\u2019ll never know if you never ask, and that leads me to my first advice, which is to find another time and have a thoughtful conversation with them. As we all know, all parents like to over worry about their children\u2019s future, and I guess yours are no exception. That being said, I recommend you to sit down and come up with all the small steps that you\u2019ll take to make sure you can become a vet before having another conversation about your plan with them. Doing so will increase your chance of winning your parents approval as the specific details about how you\u2019d take actions to go after your plan can drive out the uncertainties that linger in your parents\u2019 mind. When I went about convincing my parents to let me continue chasing after my dream of being a writer, that\u2019s how I did it, so I think this strategy can do the trick in your situation as well.</p> <p>While having another conversation with your parents is important, your parents may still not buy your plan. After all, being a vet in Hong Kong is not a walk in the park since only one local university offers veterinary training for students. While pursuing a career as a vet, many students give up when they find out how hard it is to get into the veterinary medicine program. Even when students have started their veterinary studies, they may realize that they are not fit for this career. I believe that you\u2019re not the type of person who will simply quit when things get tough. Yet, I\u2019m not so sure if your parents feel the same way. As far as I know, many Hong Kong parents are overprotective, so they rarely let their kids face the challenges themselves. Because of that, many parents don\u2019t want their children to take the thorny path that is full of obstacles as they think their children probably can\u2019t handle it.</p> <p>In order for you to persuade your parents, you should not lose sight of your dream or get discouraged simply because they don\u2019t believe in your ability to overcome the obstacles in your journey to become a vet. Instead, you should take more actions to prove yourself. You can start by volunteering for one of the animal shelters in your community. That way you can have a chance to learn about how to take care of animals. Meanwhile, you need to study extremely hard for the DSE exams since the competition for a place in the veterinary medicine program is very intense. On top of that, you should strive to get an internship or a summer job at a local veterinary clinic in order to get some hands-on experience in treating sick animals and gain some insights from the vets working in the industry. Last but not least, you can start researching about studying abroad since the chance for you receiving veterinary training overseas is higher given that the number of veterinary schools in countries like Australia and America is higher than that of Hong Kong. By doing all these, you can show to your parents that you\u2019re serious about your dream, and I\u2019m confident that they\u2019ll be moved by your perseverance.</p> <p>Before I close this letter, I want to leave you with a quote from the famous actor Will Smith which says, \u2018If you have a dream, you have to protect it.\u2019 With that being said, I hope you find not only some useful advice but also comfort and encouragement in my letter. Just remember that I'll always be cheering for you, and I wish you best of luck with your future.</p> <p>Sincerely, Chris Wong</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2019_partA/","title":"DSE 2019 Paper 2 Part A Sample","text":""},{"location":"writing/samples/2019_partA/#write-about-one-subject-that-you-enjoyed-studying-or-found-challenging","title":"Write about one subject that you enjoyed studying or found challenging","text":"<p>As I reflect on my time in Class 6C at Kowloon Secondary School, one subject that stands out is my elective\u2014English Literature.

As highlighted in the excerpt from Hong Kong Daily Press, a century ago, businesses primarily recruited individuals from their local communities. However, in the modern era, companies seek the best talent from around the world to remain competitive. This shift has brought significant benefits to Hong Kong society, but it also presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring that local communities are not left behind. In this essay, I am going to explore the advantages and challenges of international talent in Hong Kong and discuss how we can balance global integration with local empowerment.</p> <p>One of the most significant benefits of hiring international talent is the diversity of skills and perspectives they bring. Hong Kong, as a global financial hub, thrives on innovation and adaptability. Professionals from different countries introduce fresh ideas, unique expertise, and global best practices, which can enhance productivity and creativity in various industries. For example, international experts in technology, finance, and healthcare have contributed to Hong Kong\u2019s development as a leading center for innovation and trade. Their presence also fosters cross-cultural understanding, enriching the social fabric of the city and promoting a more inclusive society.</p> <p>Moreover, international talent can strengthen Hong Kong\u2019s position in the global economy. By attracting top professionals, the city can maintain its competitiveness and attract foreign investment. This, in turn, creates job opportunities and drives economic growth, benefiting both local and international residents. For instance, multinational corporations often set up regional headquarters in Hong Kong, and this can bring new employment opportunities to Hong Kong and boost the local economy.</p> <p>However, the influx of international talent also poses challenges, particularly for local communities. One major concern is the potential displacement of local workers. Highly skilled international professionals may outcompete locals for top positions, leaving fewer opportunities for homegrown talent. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and resentment among local residents, who may feel that their contributions are undervalued. Additionally, the rising cost of living driven by demand from expatriates can strain local families, exacerbating social inequality.</p> <p>To address these challenges, it is essential to implement policies that ensure local communities are not neglected. First, the government and businesses should invest in education and training programs to upskill local workers. By equipping them with the knowledge and expertise needed to compete in the global economy, Hong Kong can create a more level playing field. For example, partnerships between universities and industries can provide hands-on training and internships, preparing local graduates for high-demand roles.</p> <p>Second, companies should adopt inclusive hiring practices that prioritize diversity while also recognizing local talent. This could involve setting quotas or targets for hiring local employees or creating mentorship programs where international professionals share their expertise with local colleagues. Such initiatives can foster collaboration and ensure that local workers benefit from the presence of international talent.</p> <p>Finally, the government should implement policies to address the social and economic impacts of globalization. For instance, affordable housing initiatives and subsidies for low-income families can help mitigate the rising cost of living. Additionally, promoting cultural exchange programs can build bridges between international and local communities, fostering mutual understanding and respect.</p> <p>In conclusion, the integration of international talent into Hong Kong society brings numerous benefits, from driving innovation to strengthening the city\u2019s global standing. However, it is crucial to address the challenges it poses to local communities. By investing in education, adopting inclusive hiring practices, and implementing supportive policies, Hong Kong can harness the advantages of globalization while ensuring that local residents are not left behind. Striking this balance will be key to building a prosperous and inclusive society for all.</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2020_partA/","title":"DSE 2020 Paper 2 Part A: Restaurant Review","text":"<p>A Stylish Dim Sum Experience \u2013 But Not Without Flaws</p> <p>Last weekend, I finally got a table at Dim Sum One, the new Cantonese restaurant that everyone in Hong Kong seems to be talking about these days. As a foodie who loves a unique dining experience to celebrate special occasions, I had high expectations \u2014 and for the most part, they were met.</p> <p>First of all, let me start with the positives. The restaurant\u2019s interior was modern yet elegant, with soft lighting and a panoramic view of Victoria Harbour. It felt perfect for celebrating my bestie\u2019s birthday \u2014 intimate, yet lively. The staff were polite and attentive, always ready to explain the menu and offer suggestions.</p> <p>Now, we can focus on the food. The food was beautifully presented and creatively reinvented. Classic dishes like siu mai and har gow (shrimp dumpling) were given a modern twist, and the truffle-infused rice rolls were a pleasant surprise. We also tried their limited-edition \u201clava custard buns,\u201d which were rich and indulgent.</p> <p>However, the experience wasn\u2019t perfect. The portions were quite small for the price, and some dishes, like the abalone dumplings, were more style than substance because the abalone was a too chewy and lacked the tenderness. While the ambience was elegant, the noise level was higher than expected, which made conversation slightly difficult.</p> <p>Overall, I would recommend Dim Sum One for special occasions \u2014 birthdays, anniversaries, or if you want to impress some out-of-town guests. Just be prepared to pay a premium for the experience and lower your expectation for having a quiet meal. It\u2019s not your everyday dim sum spot, but it does deliver a memorable night out. </p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2020_partB_3/","title":"DSE 2020 Part B Q3 Stationary Stores Sample","text":"<p>A Decline of Independent Stationery Stores in Hong Kong: Can We Save Them?</p> <p>Introduction: A Shrinking Landscape</p> <p>Over the past few years, Hong Kong has witnessed a significant decline in the number of small independent stationery stores, and this phenomenon has sounded an alarm about the future of these local businesses. Once vibrant hubs of creativity and community, many of these shops are struggling to compete with larger retail chains and the growing dominance of online shopping. But according to an industry report published earlier this year, the number of independent stationery stores has decreased by nearly 30% over the past five years. In the following paragraphs, I am going to shed light on the factors contributing to this trend and discuss whether the independent stationary stores can survive in the future.</p> <p>Factors Behind the Decline</p> <p>The trend can be attributed to several factors that have collectively placed immense pressure on independent retailers. Firstly, the emergence of e-commerce in Hong Kong has transformed consumer behavior by and large. With customers increasingly opting for the convenience of online purchases, small indenpent shops will lose its customers to the online shops as they cannot offer the same convenience of accpeting e-payments and offering quick delivery. Major platforms like Taobao offer a wider selection at competitive prices, making it difficult for independent stores to attract customers. Many shoppers prefer the ease of browsing online and having products delivered directly to their homes instead of going to the store to shop for products in person.</p> <p>Additionally, the high cost of rent in Hong Kong further squeezes the margins of small retailers. With rents skyrocketing in prime shopping districts such as Mong Kok and Sha Tin, many independent stationery stores find it challenging to cover operational costs and even stay in business. Even if those small independent retailers move to the suburban areas, they still cannot make a lot of profit due to the lack of footfall in those areas. As a result, some have been forced to close down, unable to sustain their businesses in such a competitive business environment.</p> <p>The Survival Strategies\u2014How Independent Stationary Cope With the Challenges</p> <p>Despite these challenges, some independent stationery stores are finding ways to survive and even thrive by focusing on niche markets. For instance, shops that offer unique, handmade products or specialized art supplies have managed to carve out a loyal customer base from students taking Visual Arts at secondary school and college students majoring in art related subjects. These stores often emphasize quality and individuality, attracting consumers who value craftsmanship over mass-produced items. Moreover, a lot of independent stationary shops remain in business because they manage to foster a strong sense of community through holding or sponsoring community events like art exhibitions and fun fairs. By hosting these types of community events, these businesses not only promote their products but also establish a strong presence of their brand name so that more people will recoginise them.</p> <p>Looking Ahead</p> <p>Nevertheless, the future remains uncertain. The survival of independent stationery stores in Hong Kong will largely depend on their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer preferences. Embracing a hybrid model that combines online and in-store experiences may provide a viable path forward. Some small independent stationary stores have already started selling their products online through social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook. They allowing customers to browse their products online through photos and short videos while still offering personalized in-store experiences.</p> <p>As the city continues to evolve, it is crucial for these local businesses to innovate and find new ways to connect with their communities. The resilience of independent stationery stores will depend on their ability to navigate the challenges ahead and remain relevant in a fast-changing retail landscape. At the same time, we should also cherish local business as they represent our culture and can offer a more personalised shopping experience than international large retail chains. Perhaps, we should check out the small stationary shops in our neighbourhood first when we need to shop for stationary the next time.</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2021_partA/","title":"DSE 2021 Paper 2 Part A Speech Sample","text":"<p>This\u2019s Chris from the school fair committee, and today I have an exciting announcement to make.

Despite the fact that studies have repeatedly shown that EVs produce fewer emissions and contribute less to climate change than petrol-powered cars, it is alarming that less than 3% of all vehicles sold in 2020 worldwide were electric. This raises an important question: why are consumers still hesitant to make the switch? In the following paragraphs, I am going to discuss the reasons behind the low sales of EVs and offer some suggestions on what can be done to attract people to adopt EVs.</p> <p>One of the primary reasons for the slow adoption of EVs is their high upfront cost. Although EVs are becoming more affordable over time, they are still significantly more expensive than traditional petrol cars. Many consumers are discouraged by the hefty price tag, even if they acknowledge the long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Furthermore, government subsidies and incentives for EV buyers remain insufficient in many countires, making it financially impractical for the average consumer to choose an electric car over a petrol-powered one. Given the high cost and a lack of subsidies, people will not have the financial incentives to opt for EVs when they decide to purchase a car. </p> <p>Another major barrier is the lack of charging infrastructure. Unlike petrol stations, which are readily available in most urban and rural areas, charging stations for EVs are still relatively scarce. In cities like Hong Kong, where many residents live in high-rise buildings without private parking spaces, the difficulty of charging an EV discourages potential buyers. The fear of running out of battery power without access to a nearby charging station\u2014often referred to as \"range anxiety\"\u2014is a significant concern, particularly for those who frequently travel long distances. Due to the lack of charging infrastructure and the anxiety it may bring, people have very little reason to adopt EVs.</p> <p>Moreover, the limited variety of EV models available on the market plays a role in the slow adoption rate. Traditional car manufacturers offer a wide range of petrol and hybrid vehicles\u2014ranging from sports cars and luxury sedan to minivan and family cars. By offering various models, the traditional car companies can cater for different consumer needs. In comparison, the selection of EVs remains relatively small. For instance, the EV giant Tesla only offers three models for their flagship EVs, namely Model X, Model Y, and Model 3. Consequently, many consumers are hesitant to switch because they cannot find an electric vehicle that meets their preferences, whether in terms of size, performance, or design.</p> <p>To encourage more people to transition to electric vehicles, several measures should be taken. First and foremost, governments must introduce stronger financial incentives, such as larger subsidies, tax reductions, and interest-free loans for EV buyers. These policies would make EVs more accessible to and affordable for a broader range of consumers and help bridge the price gap between electric and petrol-powered cars. Knowing the subsidies, tax reductions and interest-free loans one can get, potential car buyers can be financially incentivised to opt for an EV instead of its petrol-powered counterpart. </p> <p>Second, expanding the charging infrastructure is crucial at the moment. Governments and private companies should invest in building more fast-charging stations in convenient locations such as shopping malls, public car parks, and residential areas. In addition, policies should be implemented to encourage property developers to install EV charging points in new buildings, making it easier for residents to charge their vehicles at home. On top of that, the governments all over the world should encourage more utility companies to partner with private enterprise to provide EV charger rental service for EV owners. In Hong Kong, the Smart Charge EV charger rental service offered by CLP, a utility company, and HKT, a private telecommunication enterprise, provides a case in point. With the increase of charging stations and more accesses to EV charging services, people will find owning EV less inconvenient and thus feel less worried about adopting the EVs.</p> <p>Furthermore, car manufacturers should work on producing a wider variety of EV models to cater to different consumer needs. For instance, EV companies can learn from the design of the EV sports car model Taycan designed by Porsche as well as Lexus\u2019s all-electric SUV model RZ.  By offering vehicles with different sizes and features, more people may find an EV that suits their lifestyle and needs. On top of that, public awareness campaigns should also be launched to educate consumers about the long-term financial benefits and environmental impact of driving an electric car since many people remain misinformed about EVs. EV makers can collaborate with YouTubers and celebrities to create videos about how EVs can enhance their travel or driving experience and help them save money while creating less carbon footprint on each drive. Addressing these misconceptions could help increase demand.</p> <p>In conclusion, while electric vehicles offer a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to petrol cars, various challenges\u2014including high costs, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of model variety\u2014are preventing widespread adoption. However, with stronger financial incentives, improved infrastructure, and wider range of options, we can encourage more people to make the switch. Only by addressing these barriers can we ensure a greener and more sustainable future for transportation.</p> <p>Yours faithfully, Chris Wong</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2022_partA/","title":"2022 Paper 2 Part A: Guide for Visitor","text":""},{"location":"writing/samples/2022_partA/#about-hong-kong-adventure-farm","title":"About Hong Kong Adventure Farm","text":"<p>Welcome to Hong Kong Adventure Farm (HKAF)!

Welcome to the end-of-season dinner celebration! It\u2019s my honour to be standing right here in front of you and share a few words about what we\u2019ve been through as a team in this season before you enjoy the dinner. Tonight, I\u2019m going to first talk about ouor achievement, a lesson that we learned as well as what we can expect in the future.</p> <p>To begin with, I believe it\u2019ll miss no one\u2019s attention that our team reached the inter-school championship final but unfortunately came second because this year it\u2019s the frist time ever that our school\u2019s basketball team manasged to advance all the way to the final at the inter-school championship. Even though we\u2019re defeated in the final, we\u2019ve still made history for not only reaching the final but also for notching the best record during the regular season of the inter-school basketball league. For many of us, what we\u2019ve achieved this year is undeniably a cause for celebration, and hence we\u2019re gathering here for a celebration dinner so that we can share our joy and the fruit of our hard work and sacrifice.</p> <p>Despite our achievements and glory, I\u2019m not content with being the first runner-up in the inter-school basketball championship while holding the best record in the league, not because I\u2019m greedy for more glories, but because I know we could have done better. Since I\u2019ve been leading the team for two consecutive seasons as a captain, I\u2019m well aware of each and every member\u2019s potential and skills. On top of that, the \u201ctriangle strategy\u201d dewveloped by our respectrable coach Mr.Smith is impeccable and well-suited for out team. Otherwise, we couldn\u2019t have snatched the record-high 32 wins during the regular season. After losing in the final, it began to dawn on us that our definition of \u201cgood game\u201d was not good enough, and we believed that we need to train harder, learn faster, and play smarter in the future until we top the chart and bring the trophy back to our school. That\u2019s a tough and bitter lesson we learned from the past season, and I believe it\u2019ll make us more formidable in the future.</p> <p>Moving on, our team will continue to train under the guidance of Mr. Smith. In fact, we\u2019ve already held several team meetings to set up the training schedule for the next season. What\u2019s more exciting is that our school principal is generous enough to accept out request to bring in Ms. Young, who will serve as our new physical therapist and conditioning coach in the next season because we have to stay healthy to remain competitive in the league. On top of that, I still can vividly recall how we had a lot of turnovers during the fourth quarter of the final due to fatigue. Because of that, I\u2019m convinced that Ms Young can improve our physical conditions through her thoughtful conditioning scheme. With the help of Ms Young and Mr. Smith, I expect we\u2019ll start a new chapter of our school\u2019s basketball history, and it\u2019ll be one that\u2019s filled with flories and trophie.</p> <p>Although the prospect of our school\u2019s basketball will be bright, I\u2019m disheartened to say that I won\u2019t be there to witness it with you all as I\u2019m graduating this year. People may say that \u201cno one will remember the first-runner up as only the champion will be remembered.\u201d But I beg to differ, because I will always remember how we persevered in the face of adversity, how we went against all odds as we defeated all the basketball powerhouses one by one in our school district to reach the final, and how we fought until the final whistle in the last quarter of the championship game. As the greatest basketball player of all time Michael Jordan has once said, \u201cI can accept failure, but I can\u2019t accept not trying.\u201d I think that we\u2019ve tried our best and left everything on the court, so we shoulld have no regret. </p> <p>Now we should give ourselves some credits and more importantly, we should also thank our principal, who is a huge fan of our team, as well as Mr. Smith for their unconditional support. Thank you for listening and letting me be your captain. Without further ado, let the celebration begin!</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2023_partA/","title":"DSE 2023 Paper 2 Part A: Application Form","text":"<p>Company Profile</p> <p>Planet Smart is a leading company specializing in eco-friendly products that enhance sustainable living.

Fans from all walks of life came together to celebrate their love for Japanese pop culture, and the result was a spectacular fusion of creativity, fandom, and passion.</p> <p>As a school reporter, I had the privilege of attending the event and experiencing its wonders firsthand for free. From eye-catching cosplay to thrilling activities, the Anime Expo was truly a feast for the senses. Here are some highlights from this incredible event.</p> <p>The World of Cosplay: Bringing Characters to Life</p> <p>One of the most striking aspects of the Anime Expo was the cosplay. As I strolled through the convention hall, I was greeted by a dazzling array of costumes that brought beloved characters to life. Among the most popular cosplays were characters from the hit anime series Demon Slayer and Attack on Titan.</p> <p>To understand more about the cosplayers, I gathered up my courage to interview two cosplayers who stood out in the crowd. The first was Sarah, an 18-year-old dressed as Nezuko Kamado from Demon Slayer. Her costume was meticulously crafted, from the pink-patterned kimono to the signature bamboo muzzle. \u201cIt took me three months to make this costume,\u201d Sarah shared. \u201cI love Nezuko\u2019s resilience and kindness, and I wanted to honor her by getting every detail right.\u201d</p> <p>Next, I spoke with Jason, a university student from Shenzhen who cosplayed as Levi, the stoic and skilled soldier from Attack on Titan. His military uniform, complete with the detailed Survey Corps emblem, looked as though it had been plucked straight from the anime. \u201cLevi is my favorite character because of his courage and dedication to his team,\u201d Jason explained. \u201cCosplaying him makes me feel like I can channel some of his unshakable determination.\u201d It was inspiring to see how much effort and creativity went into these cosplays. For many attendees, cosplay is not just a hobby\u2014it\u2019s an art to connect with their favorite characters and share their passion with others.</p> <p>Exciting Activities and Exhibits</p> <p>The Anime Expo offered much more than just cosplay. The venue was filled with vendor booths selling exclusive merchandise, artist alleys showcasing breathtaking fan art, and gaming areas where attendees could try out the latest video games. I even got to play a demo of a new Attack on Titan video game, which perfectly captured the thrill of battling Titans.</p> <p>One of the most popular attractions was the Demon Slayer Experience Zone, where fans could immerse themselves in the world of Tanjiro and his companions. The interactive exhibits included a replica of the iconic Mugen Train and a photo booth where fans could pose with their favorite characters.</p> <p>In the afternoon, panel discussions featuring voice actors, professional cosplayers, and manga artists were held. Fans had the chance to ask questions and gain insight into the creative process behind their favorite shows and games. For aspiring artists and creators, these panels were both informative and inspiring.</p> <p>A Celebration of Community</p> <p>What made the Anime Expo truly special was the sense of community.

A century ago, it was not uncommon for women in Hong Kong to have an average of five children. Fast forward to today, that number has dramatically decreased to less than one child per woman. This radical shift raises questions about the evolving desires and decisions surrounding family planning. This essay aims to outline several reasons why having fewer children is perceived as more desirable today than in the past, including economic considerations, changing gender roles, the impact of education, and the influence of urbanization.</p> <p>Firstly, one of the most compelling reasons for having fewer children today is the economic burden associated with raising a family. In the past, large families often relied on collective income from multiple children, who could contribute financially to the household as they grew older. However, in contemporary Hong Kong, the cost of living has skyrocketed, with housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses placing considerable strain on parents. Raising a child today requires a considerable financial investment, often reaching millions in Hong Kong dollars by the time they reach adulthood. Families are increasingly opting for fewer children to ensure they can provide a better standard of living, education, and opportunities for each child.</p> <p>Moreover, gender roles and societal expectations have evolved significantly since the early 20th century. Previously, women were often viewed primarily as caregivers and homemakers, with their identity largely tied to motherhood. In contrast, today\u2019s women are encouraged to pursue higher education and professional aspirations. Many women in Hong Kong prioritize their careers and personal development over family building. With increased participation in the workforce and a desire for independence, many women are choosing to delay marriage and childbirth or forgo it altogether. This shift reflects a broader societal understanding that a woman\u2019s value extends beyond her reproductive capabilities.</p> <p>Furthermore, access to education has fundamentally shifted the landscape of family planning. As educational opportunities have expanded, both men and women are more informed about reproductive health, family planning methods, and the implications of parenthood. This knowledge empowers couples to make informed decisions about the timing and size of their families. Modern contraception methods have also become widely available and socially accepted, providing couples with the ability to effectively plan their families according to their circumstances and preferences.</p> <p>Urbanization has also played a crucial role in the decline in birth rates. Hong Kong, as a bustling metropolis, faces unique challenges. The high population density and limited living space have made large families less practical. Many couples living in small flats feel that accommodating multiple children is simply unfeasible. The fast-paced urban lifestyle often emphasizes individualism and personal fulfillment, further contributing to the trend of smaller family sizes. Lastly, changing attitudes toward parenting and family life cannot be overlooked. Couples today often strive to create a balanced work-life environment, recognizing the time and emotional investment required for raising children. As a result, many prefer to have fewer children to maintain a high quality of family life, ensuring that they can dedicate the necessary time and attention to each child.</p> <p>In conclusion, the drastic decline in the average number of children per woman in Hong Kong from five to less than one can be attributed to various interrelated factors, including economic pressures, evolving gender roles, increased access to education, urbanization, and shifting attitudes toward family life. These changes reflect a broader societal evolution that prioritizes quality of life and personal fulfillment over traditional norms of large families. As Hong Kong continues to navigate these changes, it is essential to understand and support the diverse family structures that emerge in this dynamic environment. Ultimately, the choice of how many children to have is deeply personal and reflects the values and norms of today\u2019s society.</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2025_fall_band_letter/","title":"Fall 2025 Band Letter Writing","text":""},{"location":"writing/samples/2025_fall_band_letter/#level-5-sample-louiss-vomit-draft","title":"Level 5 Sample (Louis\u2019s Vomit Draft)","text":"<p>Dear Blue Day,</p> <p>Last week, your band announced the upcoming world tour, and during the tour, your band is scheduled to perform live in many Asian cities. But unfortunately, Hong Kong is not one of them. As a devoted fan and the president of the Hong Kong Blue Day Fan Club, I\u2019m writing this letter to share my thoughts on Hong Kong not being one of your stops in the worldwide tour and express my hope for you to reconsider your decision.</p> <p>To begin with, Hong Kong has been experiencing a revival for rock music since last year as more and more people get to listen to rock bands from all over the world playing live in Hong Kong. As Mary, our beloved guitarist and lead vocalist of Blue Day, mentioned in her answer to a fan asking why Hong Kong was not selected as one of the destinations for this world tour, you all have been told that the hardcore rock music is not a genre that is popular in Hong Kong. However, I want to clarify that this must be yesterday\u2019s news because, thanks to the Mega Event Economy policy, our government has been putting a tremendous effort to invite musicians and artists across different genres to perform in Hong Kong in order to enrich and expand the residents\u2019 musical taste. Because of that, many other hardcore rock acts from America and the United Kingdoms\u2014such as Heavy Duty Machine, Galaxy Train, and Hotplay, just to name a few\u2014have either played in Hong Kong as a part of their world tour or performed live in our music festivals like the Clockenflap. As Hong Kongers have more exposure to rock music, the number of rock fans in Hong Kong has also increased significantly from around 16% of Hong Kong residents in 2023 to about 48% of Hong Kongers in 2025, according to a music survey conducted by South China Morning Post. That being said, the signature 90\u2019s style hardcore rock and the melodramatic lyrics that make Blue Day unique will definitely receive a heart-felt welcome from the Hong Kong rock fans.</p> <p>Besides the revival of rock music, the Blue Day fanbase in Hong Kong is growing stronger and stronger every day because your band has been using your music to build a platform to spread empowering messages to fans and advocate for better mental health support. A few years ago, when I first took the initiative to set up the fan club, we only had around 100 active members. But today, the number has grown to 1,121 members. What\u2019s more important is that unlike other band\u2019s fans who only focus on their bands or idols, we are highly motivated to empower others and act as an advocate for mental health because we are deeply touched by the messages from your music. As the president of the fan club in the city, I have witnessed firsthand how your music inspires the listeners to not only join the fan club but also volunteer at local non-governmental organisations which serve people with mental health issues. In fact, recently our fan club has come up with an initiative to set up a philanthropic campaign called \u201cWith You\u201d, which is named after your first song on self-acceptance, and our campaign aims to sponsor the establishment of mental health hotline at various community centers in Hong Kong. Given the growth of the fan club as well as our active pursuits to advocate for better mental health, your performance in Hong Kong would only make them feel more motivated to spread the messages about mental health and work harder to make our community a better place for promoting mental healh, and all the fans in Hong Kong would not let you down if you decided to add an additional show in Hong Kong.</p> <p>In addition to the growing fandom in Hong kong, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how much Blue Day means to me. Few years ago, while I was studying for the high-pressure college entrance exams during the covid pandemic, I felt very depressed and hopeless because schools were closed and I couldn\u2019t hang out with my friends during that difficult time. But fortunately, I came across two of your songs \u201cWith You\u201d and \u201cStronger Together\u201d, and the upbeat rhythm and powerful vocal light up my mood and ignite my hope for a better and brighter future. On top of that, the lyrics from those songs encouraged me to be resilient and tenacious even during difficult times. More importantly, your songs reminded me the importance of seeking allies in adversity because we cannot fight alone when facing uphill battles like overcoming mental health issues or getting through the pandemic. Shortly after listening to your songs, I reach out to my friends via Zoom and social media, and we built up the camaraderie that propelled us to get through the difficult period together. Looking back, I can confidently say that if I had not discovered your music back then, I would not have done well in my college entrance exam and remained hopeful for the future, not to mention getting into university to study psychology and running a fan club that advocates for better mental health in Hong Kong. Although I cannot speak for all the fans, I\u2019m positive that most of the Hong Kongers become your fans, not just because they liked rock music, but because your songs resonated with them deeply especially during the difficult times. Because your music has accompanied us through all the ups and downs, we genuinely hope that your band would have another discussion about whether Hong Kong should be added as one of the destinations during the Asia leg of your world.</p> <p>Based on what I have mentioned above, I hope I have managed to cast out the doubt that you have about your music not being popular in Hong Kong, show you how much impact your music has for our fans, and share with you how much we would love to see Blue Day play a live show in Hong Kong. If your band decided play in Hong Kong, we would sing along to every song you play and scream our lungs out so that your band\u2019s message would be heard loud and clear in our city. Thank you for reading this letter, and regardless of your final decision, all the fans, including myself, will support your band forever. To close the letter, I wish your band all the best and success with your upcoming world tour!</p> <p>Best regards, Chris Wong A devoted fan from Hong Kong</p>"},{"location":"writing/samples/2025_fall_band_letter/#level-5-sample-concise-ai-version","title":"Level 5 Sample (Concise AI Version)","text":"<p>Dear Blue Day,</p> <p>As the president of your devoted Hong Kong Fan Club, I am writing to implore you to reconsider the omission of our city from your upcoming world tour. The belief that your music lacks an audience here is a painful misconception, and I hope to show you the passionate, thriving community that awaits you.</p> <p>Contrary to what you\u2019ve been told, Hong Kong is experiencing a rock music renaissance. Driven by pro-arts government policies, our city has recently hosted major international rock acts, including Hotplay and Galaxy Train, to sold-out crowds at festivals like Clockenflap. This exposure has ignited the public's appetite; a recent South China Morning Post survey reveals a surge in rock listenership, from 16% in 2023 to nearly 50% today. Your signature 90s sound would not just be welcomed; it would be celebrated.</p> <p>Beyond market size, your Hong Kong fanbase is one of the most dedicated and mission-driven you have. Inspired by your powerful advocacy for mental health, our fan club has grown tenfold. More importantly, we have translated your message into action. We recently launched \u201cWith You,\u201d a philanthropic initiative named after your song on self-acceptance, which funds mental health hotlines in local community centres. A live performance in Hong Kong would galvanize these efforts and powerfully amplify the message of hope you champion.</p> <p>On a personal level, your music was my lifeline. During the isolating pandemic and the immense pressure of university entrance exams, your songs \u201cWith You\u201d and \u201cStronger Together\u201d were more than just music; they were anthems of resilience. They inspired me to seek camaraderie, persevere, and ultimately pursue a degree in psychology. My story is not unique. Your music resonates here because it offers strength in adversity, and we yearn to share that collective energy with you in person.</p> <p>Hong Kong is not just a potential market; it is a city full of fans whose lives you have already changed. We are ready to sing every word and prove that this is where you belong. Thank you for your consideration. We wish you a successful tour, hoping it will include us.</p> <p>Best regards, Chris Wong President, Hong Kong Blue Day Fan Club</p> <p>Produced by Gemini</p>"}]}
